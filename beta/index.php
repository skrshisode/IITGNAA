					I am doing Masters of Product Development at Carnegie Mellon University. The course is very inter disciplinary and I am taking classes in business, design, entrepreneurship and engineering. Its just been a month here in Pittsburgh and the life has been very exciting - meeting new people everyday, free food cook outs and managing time with assignments, cooking, apartment setting. There is just so much different kinds of experience that you get everyday.

					After completing my BTech in Mechanical Engineering, I am pursuing a PhD from Caltech, Pasadena California. Broadly I am interested in computational solid mechanics and will work on quasi-continuum methods for my research. Grad school life is awesome and I have spent the past year getting acquainted with the new culture here, the course load, the work, and of course, the fun. I picked up tennis after coming here and play it regularly in addition to badminton. In general, I have a pretty good mix of a personal and social life. Thus, life is all set for lots of excitement till I graduate (if I graduate!)

					Life here is great! I get to learn a lot of new things- instruments that we read of in the books, I'm 
					getting to use them. I'm getting involved in different projects, most of which are interdisciplinary in nature, which is one of the best things at Duke! I've made friends from different places.. And I'm 
					getting to know their cultures..their way of living. In a nutshell, I'm enjoying how this place has so 
					many experiences to offer!
